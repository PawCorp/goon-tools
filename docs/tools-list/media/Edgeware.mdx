# Edgeware
**A "virus" that tries to keep you edged**

> https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware

  - A fake porn "virus" that will randomly fill your screen with porn of your choosing.
  - Can be set to randomly replace files with porn, but this is optional and disabled by default.
  - Many people have already made porn packs to use with Edgeware.

## Compatibility

<Compatibility windows other={{msg: "It's a Python script, might run in other places with some effort"}} />

## Download
  - The script itself can be downloaded from https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware
    - Click the green "Code" button at the top, then click "Download as zip"
    - Unzip the archive into a new folder. You must do this. It will not run from inside the zip archive.
    - Double click EdgewareSetup.bat if you're on windows. This will set everything up for you.
  - Make your own packs with https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware-Pack-Editor

## Packs
  - If any downloads includes edgeware its self with the pack, it has the potential of including unwanted files or harmful edits. So only take the contents of its resource folder if that's the case

## Troubleshooting
### The panic button doesn't work
  - It doesn't
### I can't open the script
  - You need to have python3 installed. Run the ./EdgewareSetup.bat script to install python. If that doesn't work, you can install it manually from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
