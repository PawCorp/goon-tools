# Edgeware
**A "virus" that tries to keep you edged**

> https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware

  - A fake porn "virus" that will randomly fill your screen with porn of your choosing.
  - Can be set to randomly replace files with porn, but this is optional and disabled by default.
  - Many people have already made porn packs to use with Edgeware.

## Compatibility

<Compatibility windows other={{msg: "It's a Python script, might run in other places with some effort"}} />

## Download
  - The script itself can be downloaded from https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware
    - Click the green "Code" button at the top, then click "Download as zip"
    - Unzip the archive into a new folder. You must do this. It will not run from inside the zip archive.
    - Double click EdgewareSetup.bat if you're on windows. This will set everything up for you.
  - Make your own packs with https://github.com/PetitTournesol/Edgeware-Pack-Editor

## Troubleshooting
### The panic button doesn't work
  - It doesn't
### I can't open the script
  - You need to have python3 installed. Run the ./EdgewareSetup.bat script to install python. If that doesn't work, you can install it manually from https://www.python.org/downloads/.
